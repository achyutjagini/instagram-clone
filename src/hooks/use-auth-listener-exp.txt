
This code defines a custom React Hook named useAuthListener.
Custom hooks are a way
to reuse logic
across multiple components in a React application.

The useAuthListener hook uses the useState hook to define a user state variable and the 
useContext hook to get access to the FirebaseContext object, which contains a reference 
to the Firebase authentication service. The user state variable is initialized with the 
value stored in the browser's localStorage object under the key authUser.

The useEffect hook is used to add an authentication state change listener to the
Firebase authentication service. This listener is triggered whenever the user's
authentication state changes, such as when they log in or log out. Inside the
listener callback function, the authUser parameter is used to update the user
state variable and store it in localStorage. If the authUser parameter is null,
the user state variable is set to null and the authUser key is
removed from localStorage.

Finally, the useAuthListener hook returns an object with a single property
named user, which contains the current value of the user state variable.
Components that use this hook can get access to the current 
authenticated user by calling useAuthListener().user.
