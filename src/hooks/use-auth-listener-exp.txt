
This code defines a custom React Hook named useAuthListener.
Custom hooks are a way
to reuse logic
across multiple components in a React application.

The useAuthListener hook uses the useState hook to define a user state variable and the 
useContext hook to get access to the FirebaseContext object, which contains a reference 
to the Firebase authentication service. The user state variable is initialized with the 
value stored in the browser's localStorage object under the key authUser.

The useEffect hook is used to add an authentication state change listener to the
Firebase authentication service. This listener is triggered whenever the user's
authentication state changes, such as when they log in or log out. Inside the
listener callback function, the authUser parameter is used to update the user
state variable and store it in localStorage. If the authUser parameter is null,
the user state variable is set to null and the authUser key is
removed from localStorage.

Finally, the useAuthListener hook returns an object with a single property
named user, which contains the current value of the user state variable.
Components that use this hook can get access to the current 
authenticated user by calling useAuthListener().user.


In the useAuthListener custom hook, the line const 
listener = firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged((authUser) => {...}); creates a
 listener that listens for changes in the authentication state of the Firebase app.

The onAuthStateChanged method takes a callback function that will be called
whenever the authentication state changes. This callback function takes

an authUser parameter, which represents the user who is currently
signed in, or null if no user is signed in.

In this case, the listener variable is used to store the reference
 to the callback function returned by the onAuthStateChanged method.
  This allows us to remove the listener later when the component
 unmounts or when the firebase dependency changes.

Inside the callback function, if authUser is not null, the user
 is signed in, and their information is stored in the localStorage 
 using localStorage.setItem('authUser', JSON.stringify(authUser));, 
 so that it can be retrieved later if the user refreshes the page or
  returns to the site at a later time.

Then the authUser object is stored in the user state
 variable using setUser(authUser);.

If authUser is null, the user is signed out, so the
 localStorage is cleared using localStorage.removeItem('authUser');
  and the user state variable is set to null using setUser(null);.

Overall, this custom hook allows us to persist the authentication
 state of the user across page refreshes or when the user navigates
  away from the site, by storing the user information in
   localStorage. It also allows us to listen for changes 
   in the authentication state using the Firebase Authentication 
   API and update the user state variable accordingly


Yes, authUser is a JavaScript object that contains information 
about the signed-in user, such as their user ID (UID), email address, and display name.

When a user signs in to Firebase Authentication, the Firebase 
Authentication API returns an object representing the signed-in user. 
This object is commonly referred to as an "auth user object".

The authUser object passed to the onAuthStateChanged callback
function is an instance of the firebase.User class, which 
is provided by the Firebase Authentication library for JavaScript. 
This object contains various properties and methods that allow you
to access and manipulate the user's information and authentication state.

You can access the properties of the authUser object using
dot notation, for example, authUser.uid, authUser.email,
authUser.displayName, etc. These properties contain the 
information about the signed-in user that you 
can use in your application.



localStorage.setItem() can only store data in the form of strings. 
Therefore, when we want to store a JavaScript object or array in
 localStorage, we need to convert it to a string first.

The JSON.stringify() method converts a JavaScript object or array 
into a JSON string representation that can be stored in localStorage. 
This method serializes the object or array into a string that can be
 easily stored and retrieved from localStorage.

In the useAuthListener custom hook, we use JSON.stringify(authUser) 
to convert the authUser object (which is returned by the Firebase
 Authentication API) into a JSON string representation. This string 
 representation can be stored in localStorage using localStorage.setItem(),
 which takes two parameters: a key and a value.

The key is a string that serves as the name of the item we
 want to store in localStorage, while the value is the string 
 representation of the object or array we want to store. In 
 this case, the key is 'authUser' and the value is the JSON 
 string representation of the authUser object.

Later, when we retrieve the authUser information from 
localStorage using JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('authUser')),
 we use the JSON.parse() method to convert the JSON string back
  into a JavaScript object. This method deserializes the JSON
   string and reconstructs the original object or array.
